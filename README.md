# BibiCraft Online Shop

> eCommerce platform built with the MERN stack & Redux, showing MVC design pattern. At this stage of development the app displays on the main screen a list o products fetched from MongoDB, it has register/signin functionality, product details screen, cart functionality, user profile page that allows info update. I will continue working on the checkout process, payment methods and admin control and ultimately deploy it on Heroku.
