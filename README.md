Front-end

```
React and React-Bootstrap on the client side. The global state is managed with Redux witch was the big challenge for me so far in the project. Other dependencies: axios for fetching data from the server, react-router-dom for managing routes.
```

Server

```
Built with Node.js and Express. MongoDb to store data, object modeling with Mongoose, Bcryptjs for password encription, jsonwebtoken for accessing private routes.
```

Dev Tools

```
Git
NPM
Postman for testing routes
Nodemon and concurently
```
