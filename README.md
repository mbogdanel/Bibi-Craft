# BibiCraft Online Shop

> eCommerce platform built with the MERN stack & Redux, showing MVC design pattern. It has register/signin functionality, product details screen along with product reviews and rating, cart functionality, user profile page that allows info update, checkout process and Paypal payment integration methods, admin management of orders, products and users.

> Happy to take this one from create-react-app to Heroku deployment. I learned a whole bunch of things, added on my React skills, got better with debugging, got faster on writing code. The big challenge for me was the state management with Redux and although I am not a master yet, this code is a great reference for the future.
